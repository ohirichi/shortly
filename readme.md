# Shortly

### Overview

This project is my solution to the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)  challenge. The original resources from Frontend Mentor are located in the assets folder and the SVGs/images have been moved to the public folder.

The challenge was to build out the landing page based on the design provided and integrate it with the [rel.ink](https://rel.ink) API.

A visitor to the site should be able to input a link and get back the shortened url from the rel.ink api. The site will also display the last 5 shortened links for the user.

### Technologies Used

This landing page was built using Next.Js (<3) and deployed to Vercel (Now). It uses React Hooks and makes use of styled jsx for CSS in JS styling.

Although I really like CSS in JS libraries - I plan to eventually refactor the styling into SCSS to practice Sass a bit more.
